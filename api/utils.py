<b>Disease</b>: Pythium Chlorotic disease<br/><br/>
<b>Cause of disease</b>:<br/>
Pythium Chlorotic disease lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which Pythium Chlorotic disease damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time. Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.<br/><br/>
<b>How to prevent/cure the disease</b>:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>In order to best prevent and manage Pythium Chlorotic disease, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.</li>
  <li>This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation.</li>
  <li>High risk factors for Pythium Chlorotic disease in corn:
    
      <li>Susceptible hybrid</li>
      <li>Continuous corn</li>
      <li>Late planting date</li>
      <li>Minimum tillage systems</li>
      <li>Field history of severe disease</li>
      <li>Early disease activity (before tasseling)</li>
      <li>Irrigation</li>
      <li>Favorable weather forecast for disease</li>

<b>Disease</b>: Penicillium Leaf curling<br/><br/>
<b>Cause of disease</b>:<br/>
Penicillium Leaf curling, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary Penicillium Leaf curling diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of Penicillium fungus.<br/><br/>
<b>How to prevent/cure the disease</b>:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Although Penicillium Leaf curling is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most possess some degree of resistance.</li>
  <li>However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for Penicillium Leaf curling control.</li>

<b>Disease</b>: Rhizoctonia seedling blight<br/><br/>
<b>Cause of disease</b>:<br/>
Rhizoctonia seedling blight (RSB) is a foliar disease of corn (maize) caused by Exserohilum turcicum, the anamorph of the ascomycete Setosphaeria turcica. With its characteristic cigar-shaped lesions, this disease can cause significant yield loss in susceptible corn hybrids.<br/><br/>
<b>How to prevent/cure the disease</b>:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Management of RSB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides.</li>
  <li>Scouting fields and monitoring local conditions is vital to control this disease.</li>
